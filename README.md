# 🎣 PhishShaala

> **PhishShaala** is an interactive cybersecurity awareness platform that teaches users how to identify phishing attacks — including email scams, SMS smishing, voice vishing, and social-media deception — through guided lessons and a live scenario-based challenge.

**Live Demo:** [Add your deployed link here]

> **Architecture:** The quiz answer key is stored exclusively in Vercel serverless backend functions (`/api`) and never sent to the client. The frontend fetches only the scenario content and submits answers to the API for validation.

## ✨ Features

- **Guided Learning Modules** — Multi-level content covering email phishing, smishing, vishing, and social-media attacks
- **Advanced Deep-Dive Lessons** — Detailed module-by-module breakdown with theory, real-world examples, and safety tips
- **Interactive Quiz / Challenge** — Scenario-based quiz where users decide if an email or SMS is *phishing* or *safe*, with instant feedback
- **Score & Badge System** — Results stored in `localStorage`; scorecard calculates percentage and awards a badge (Beginner → Elite Defender)
- **Progress Tracking** — Per-module progress bar on the learning pages tracks how many modules have been reviewed
- **Dark / Light Mode Toggle** — Site-wide theme switching persisted via `localStorage`; prevents flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
- **Animated Cyber-Canvas Background** — Interactive WebGL-style particle network on the home page that reacts to mouse movement
- **Hero Parallax & Scroll-Reveal Animations** — Smooth entry animations for cards and sections as they scroll into view
- **Accordion Content Panels** — Native `<details>`/`<summary>` accordions for compact learning content
- **Alpine.js Powered Quiz UI** — Reactive quiz state management (selection, score, progress, scenario switching) without build tools
- **Responsive Layout** — Mobile-friendly across all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Hash-Based Deep Linking** — Navigate directly to a specific module via URL hash (e.g. `advance-learning.html#smishing`)

## 📄 Pages Overview

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | **Home** — Landing page with hero, feature highlights, statistics, and a call-to-action to start learning or take the challenge. Includes the animated particle canvas background. |
| `learning.html` | **Learning Center** — Introduction to phishing, with expandable accordion cards covering email phishing, smishing (SMS), and vishing (voice call) attack types, each with red-flag analysis and prevention tips. |
| `advance-learning.html` | **Advanced Learning** — In-depth module navigator with a sidebar. Each module (Email Phishing, Smishing, Vishing, Social Media, etc.) contains theory, a step-by-step attack walkthrough, a real-world example scenario, and a safety tips panel. Supports hash-based deep linking. |
| `challenge.html` | **Challenge Hub** — Interactive quiz presenting realistic email and SMS scenarios. Users click *Flag Suspicious* or *Mark Safe*, receive instant feedback, and accumulate a score. Powered by Alpine.js for zero-build reactivity. |
| `scorecard.html` | **Scorecard** — Displays the user's final quiz results: animated conic-gradient score ring, percentage, category breakdown (email vs. SMS), and a performance badge. Data is read from `localStorage`. |

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

The quiz validation requires the Vercel serverless backend. Use the **Vercel CLI** for the full experience locally:

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishshaala.git
cd phishshaala
```

**2. Install Vercel CLI (once)**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

**3. Run locally with serverless functions**
```bash
vercel dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
# API routes: http://localhost:3000/api/questions
#             http://localhost:3000/api/submit
```

> **Alternative (static pages only, quiz API won't work):**
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8080
> # Then open http://localhost:8080
> # Note: challenge.html will show a "Could not load" error without the API
> ```

## ☁️ Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# One-command deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repo to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) for automatic deployments on every push. No additional configuration needed — `vercel.json` is already set up.
